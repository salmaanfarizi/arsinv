# Google Sheets Cleanup & Migration Guide

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for cleaning up and organizing your Google Sheets without losing any data.

## Problems Addressed

1. **Daily sheet proliferation** - Multiple `SALES_*` sheets created per day per route
2. **Empty sheets** - Unused sheets cluttering the workbook
3. **Duplicate data** - Same records appearing multiple times
4. **Disorganized structure** - Difficult to find and analyze data

## Solution

The cleanup tools consolidate all sales data into a single organized sheet, making it easier to:
- Query and filter data
- Create reports and charts
- Maintain the spreadsheet
- Improve performance

## Usage Guide

### Option 1: Full Automated Cleanup (Recommended)

This is the easiest and safest option:

1. Open your Google Spreadsheet
2. Go to **Utilities â†’ Cleanup Tools â†’ Full Cleanup (Recommended)**
3. Click **Yes** to confirm
4. Wait for completion message
5. Review the `CLEANUP_SUMMARY` sheet for details

**What it does:**
- âœ… Creates automatic backup
- âœ… Consolidates all `SALES_*` sheets into `SALES_ITEMS`
- âœ… Deletes empty sheets
- âœ… Generates summary report
- âœ… All data is preserved

### Option 2: Manual Step-by-Step Cleanup

If you prefer more control:

#### A. Create Backup First (IMPORTANT!)

1. Go to **Utilities â†’ Cleanup Tools â†’ Create Backup**
2. Note the backup URL shown in the alert
3. Keep this URL safe in case you need to rollback

#### B. Consolidate Sales Sheets

1. Go to **Utilities â†’ Cleanup Tools â†’ Consolidate SALES Sheets**
2. Review the list of sheets to be consolidated
3. Click **Yes** to confirm
4. When complete, choose whether to delete old sheets

**Before:**
```
SALES_Al-Hasa 1_2025-01-15
SALES_Al-Hasa 1_2025-01-16
SALES_Al-Hasa 2_2025-01-15
SALES_Al-Hasa 2_2025-01-16
... (hundreds of sheets)
```

**After:**
```
SALES_ITEMS (single consolidated sheet)
â”œâ”€ 2025-01-15 | Al-Hasa 1 | ...
â”œâ”€ 2025-01-15 | Al-Hasa 2 | ...
â”œâ”€ 2025-01-16 | Al-Hasa 1 | ...
â””â”€ 2025-01-16 | Al-Hasa 2 | ...
```

#### C. Delete Empty Sheets

1. Go to **Utilities â†’ Cleanup Tools â†’ Delete Empty Sheets**
2. Review the list of empty sheets
3. Click **Yes** to confirm deletion

#### D. Optimize Performance

1. Go to **Utilities â†’ Cleanup Tools â†’ Optimize Spreadsheet**
2. This will:
   - Remove duplicate rows
   - Sort data by date
   - Format headers consistently
3. Click **Yes** to confirm

#### E. Generate Summary Report

1. Go to **Utilities â†’ Cleanup Tools â†’ Generate Summary Report**
2. Check the `CLEANUP_SUMMARY` sheet for:
   - Sheet sizes
   - Row counts
   - Last modified dates
   - Migration logs

## New Sheet Structure

### SALES_ITEMS Sheet

| Date | Time | Route | Category | Code | Item Name | Unit | Unit Price | Quantity | Total Value |
|------|------|-------|----------|------|-----------|------|------------|----------|-------------|
| 2025-01-15 | 14:30:22 | Al-Hasa 1 | Popcorn | 1710 | Cheese | bag | 5 | 10 | 50 |
| 2025-01-15 | 14:30:22 | Al-Hasa 1 | Seeds | 4402 | 200g | bag | 58 | 5 | 290 |
| 2025-01-16 | 09:15:33 | Al-Hasa 2 | Popcorn | 1711 | Butter | bag | 5 | 8 | 40 |

**Key Changes:**
- âœ… Added `Route` column (3rd column)
- âœ… All sales data in one sheet
- âœ… Easy to filter by Date + Route
- âœ… Easy to create pivot tables and charts

### Query Examples

**Filter sales for specific route and date:**
```
=QUERY(SALES_ITEMS!A:J, "SELECT * WHERE B='Al-Hasa 1' AND A=date '2025-01-15'")
```

**Sum total sales by route:**
```
=QUERY(SALES_ITEMS!A:J, "SELECT C, SUM(J) GROUP BY C")
```

**Get sales for date range:**
```
=QUERY(SALES_ITEMS!A:J, "SELECT * WHERE A >= date '2025-01-01' AND A <= date '2025-01-31'")
```

## Rollback Instructions

If something goes wrong, you can restore from backup:

### Method 1: Using Backup Copy

1. Open the backup file (check the URL from the cleanup alert)
2. Go to **File â†’ Make a copy**
3. Use the copy as your main spreadsheet
4. Update the `SPREADSHEET_ID` in your Apps Script

### Method 2: Version History

1. In your spreadsheet, go to **File â†’ Version history â†’ See version history**
2. Find the version before cleanup
3. Click **Restore this version**

---

## Verification Checklist

After cleanup, verify:

- [ ] `SALES_ITEMS` sheet exists and has all data
- [ ] Row count matches (check `CLEANUP_SUMMARY` sheet)
- [ ] All routes are present in the `Route` column
- [ ] Dates are correct
- [ ] No old `SALES_*` sheets remain (if you deleted them)
- [ ] Frontend still works with new sheet structure
- [ ] Can filter and query data successfully

---

## Maintenance Best Practices

### Daily
- No action needed - data automatically goes to `SALES_ITEMS`

### Weekly
- Review `CLEANUP_SUMMARY` sheet for any issues
- Check for duplicate entries

### Monthly
1. Run **Utilities â†’ Cleanup Tools â†’ Optimize Spreadsheet**
2. Create a backup: **Utilities â†’ Cleanup Tools â†’ Create Backup**
3. Archive old data if needed

### Quarterly
- Export `SALES_ITEMS` to a separate archive spreadsheet
- Clear old data from main spreadsheet (keep last 3 months)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Permission denied" error

**Solution:**
1. Go to Apps Script editor
2. Click **Deploy â†’ Manage deployments**
3. Edit deployment
4. Set "Execute as: Me"
5. Set "Who has access: Anyone"
6. Deploy again

### Issue: Data missing after consolidation

**Solution:**
1. Open the backup spreadsheet
2. Check the `CLEANUP_SUMMARY` sheet for migration log
3. Verify which sheets were processed
4. If needed, manually copy missing data

### Issue: Duplicate rows appearing

**Solution:**
1. Run **Utilities â†’ Cleanup Tools â†’ Optimize Spreadsheet**
2. This will deduplicate based on Date + Route + Code

### Issue: Menu not showing

**Solution:**
1. Close and reopen the spreadsheet
2. Wait 5-10 seconds for menus to load
3. Refresh the page if needed

### Issue: Script timeout during cleanup

**Solution:**
- This happens with very large spreadsheets (1000+ sheets)
- Run cleanup in stages:
  1. First, consolidate 50 sheets at a time manually
  2. Then run full cleanup

## Advanced Features

### Custom Deduplication

To deduplicate a specific sheet:

```javascript
// In Apps Script editor
function deduplicateCustomSheet() {
  // Deduplicate by columns 0, 2, 4 (Date, Route, Code)
  deduplicateSheet('YOUR_SHEET_NAME', [0, 2, 4]);
}
```

### Export to CSV

```javascript
function exportSalesItemsToCSV() {
  const ss = SpreadsheetApp.openById(SPREADSHEET_ID);
  const sheet = ss.getSheetByName('SALES_ITEMS');
  const data = sheet.getDataRange().getValues();

  const csv = data.map(row => row.join(',')).join('\n');

  const blob = Utilities.newBlob(csv, 'text/csv', 'sales_items.csv');
  DriveApp.createFile(blob);
}
```

### Archive Old Data

```javascript
function archiveOldData(monthsToKeep) {
  const ss = SpreadsheetApp.openById(SPREADSHEET_ID);
  const sheet = ss.getSheetByName('SALES_ITEMS');

  const cutoffDate = new Date();
  cutoffDate.setMonth(cutoffDate.getMonth() - monthsToKeep);

  // Move old data to archive sheet
  // Implementation left as exercise
}
```
