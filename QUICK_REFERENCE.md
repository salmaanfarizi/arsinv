```

**After (CORRECT):**
```javascript
diff = (physicalBase + transferBase + addTransferBase) - systemBase
```

---

## Sheet Structure

### Before
```
500+ sheets including:
- SALES_Al-Hasa 1_2025-01-01
- SALES_Al-Hasa 1_2025-01-02
- (hundreds more...)
```

### After
```
~15 sheets including:
- SALES_ITEMS (consolidated)
- Route sheets
- System sheets
```

## Query Examples

**Filter by route and date:**
```sql
=QUERY(SALES_ITEMS!A:J,
  "SELECT * WHERE C='Al-Hasa 1' AND A=date '2025-01-15'")
```

**Sum by route:**
```sql
=QUERY(SALES_ITEMS!A:J,
  "SELECT C, SUM(J) GROUP BY C LABEL C 'Route', SUM(J) 'Total'")
```

**Date range:**
```sql
=QUERY(SALES_ITEMS!A:J,
  "SELECT * WHERE A >= date '2025-01-01' AND A <= date '2025-01-31'")
```

## Emergency Rollback

### If cleanup fails:
1. Find backup in Google Drive
2. Name: `[Spreadsheet] [BACKUP 2025-01-20_...]`
3. Open backup → File → Make a copy
4. Use copy as main spreadsheet

### If frontend breaks:
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push
```
